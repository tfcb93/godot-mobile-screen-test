# Godot Mobile Screen Test

I made this project to learn more about how mobile works in Godot. The objective is to learn and master the API for mobile and work around it.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Time between taps
- [ ] Better particles when dragging across the screen
- [ ] Other gestures like pan, magnify and other stuff
- [ ] Spinning elements
- [ ] Make it a real demo so people can really use it in the future
